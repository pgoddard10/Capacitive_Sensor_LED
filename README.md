You will need:
- 1 x Arduino board
- 1 x 1M resistor 
- 1 x Touch plate
- 1x Breadboard 
- 1 x LED 
- 2 x Jumpers
- Arduino Library from https://github.com/PaulStoffregen/CapacitiveSensor

First plug in the resistor in pin 4 and pin 8 of the Arduino, then connect the touch plate with pin 8 of the Arduino.

Now plug in the LED to the breadboard, connect LED's "-" to Arduino's GND and "+" to pin 7.
