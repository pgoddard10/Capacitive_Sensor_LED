# Capacitive_Sensor_LED
A simple touch sensor which measures the resistance generated by the human touch. This allows for a single touch point rather than needing a complete circuit.

## Problem & Inspiration
Inspired by the videos linked to below, the idea is to make touch-activated sounds for objects or artworks. This would enable visually impaired people to touch any tactile surface, as long as it has a conductive layer, and trigger sounds.

## Idea & Applications
- <b>Low Cost:</b> All that's needed is an Arduino and a few cables, plus the paper and capacitive material.
- <b>For everyone:</b> Can be fun and the introduction of colours and sounds make it appealing to all.
- <b>Standards:</b> TBC
- <b>Content Updates:</b> Relies on a manual update process to the Arduino. Probably via USB and a computer, which makes updates limited.
- <b>Uses:</b> Allows any conductive object and material to be used to generate a sound. This particular program is quite basic and limited, see Future Improvements. Was useful to inspire other ideas.

## Device Compatibility
Tested on an Arduino Uno but should work on all Arduinos.

## Installation & Setup
You will need:
- 1 x Arduino board
- 1 x 1M resistor 
- 1 x Touch plate or other conductive object
- 1 x Breadboard 
- 1 x LED 
- 2 x Jumpers
- Arduino Library from https://github.com/PaulStoffregen/CapacitiveSensor

Connect as per the diagram below:

Download the Capacitive_Sensor_LED.ino Arduino file and upload to the Arduino.

## Behind the Scenes
Take a look at the .ino file - it's fairly self-explanatory.

### Workarounds Used
N/A

## Future Improvements
1. Expanded upon to make multiple touch sensors per Arduino, allowing for many inputs, similar to the videos within the inspiration section above. This could be used for either different objects (one input per object) or different touch points on a single object.
2. Experiments with different types of tactile surfaces covered in conductive materials.
3. Try to create a way to easily change the objects, perhaps using NFC tags to signal which object is being touched.
